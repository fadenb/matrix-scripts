# matrix-scripts
Random (potentially dangerous and unmaintained) scripts for the Matrix chat ecosystem

# Nix-shell?
As I use these scripts on my personal infrastructure that is NixOS based most scripts will make use of `nix-shell`.
See https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install for information on how to install `nix` (and therefore `nix-shell`)
